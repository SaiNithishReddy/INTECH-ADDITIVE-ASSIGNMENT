Random crashes can be challenging to diagnose, but there are several common suspects and techniques to isolate the cause. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Memory Issues:
   - Check for memory leaks: Use tools like Valgrind or AddressSanitizer to identify memory leaks. Leaks can accumulate over time and eventually lead to a crash.
   - Examine memory corruption: Use tools like AddressSanitizer or Valgrind to detect memory corruption issues such as out-of-bounds reads/writes, use-after-free, or double-free.

2. Thread Safety:
   - Verify thread safety: Ensure that the code is properly synchronized in a multithreaded environment. Use thread analysis tools to identify potential race conditions.

3. Exception Handling:
   - Check for unhandled exceptions: Unhandled exceptions can lead to unexpected crashes. Make sure that all possible exceptions are caught and handled appropriately.

4. External Dependencies:
   - Examine external libraries: If the code relies on external libraries, ensure they are up-to-date and compatible with your system. Check the documentation for any known issues.

5. Input Validation:
   - Validate user inputs: Check if the code properly validates and handles user inputs. Invalid inputs may lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.

6. Compiler and Optimization Flags:
   - Review compiler flags: Ensure that the correct compiler flags are being used. Sometimes, aggressive optimization levels can introduce subtle bugs.

7. Logging and Debug Information:
   - Introduce extensive logging: Add additional logging statements to trace the flow of the program. This can help identify where the crash occurs more consistently.

8. Static Code Analysis:
   - Use static analysis tools: Employ tools like Clang Static Analyzer or Coverity to analyze the code statically for potential issues.

9. Fuzz Testing:
   - Apply fuzz testing: Use a fuzzer to generate a large number of random inputs to the program. This can help uncover edge cases and trigger crashes.

10. Debugging Tools:
    - Utilize debugger: Attach a debugger like GDB or LLDB and collect information about the state of the program when it crashes. Look for patterns or commonalities in the crashes.

11. Hardware Issues:
    - Check hardware health: Ensure that the underlying hardware is in good condition. Faulty hardware can sometimes manifest as random crashes.

12. Code Review:
    - Perform a thorough code review: Review the codebase for potential issues, especially focusing on recent changes. Sometimes, an extra pair of eyes can catch subtle bugs.

By systematically investigating each of these areas, you can narrow down the possible causes of random crashes and work towards isolating and fixing the underlying issues.
